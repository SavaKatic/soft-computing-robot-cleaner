# Project Robot Cleaner - Soft Computing Course (SW) 2019/2020

## Brief Summary
This repository is a student project implementing a neural network trained to recognize peanut shells. After detecting such an object, the algorithm calculates the distance from cameras to the detected object.

A mobile application is used as a way to check if the calculated distance is correct. It also displays robot emotion on the screen (as an emoji) and should act like a robot head.

## Setup
The neural network was originally written using TensorFlow version 1.14, but will also work for newer versions of TensorFlow as well.

To install required libraries, run the following command:
pip install -r requirements.txt
